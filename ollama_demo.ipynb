      "Alright, so I need to figure out the limit as x approaches 0 of sin(x)/x. Hmm, okay. I remember from my calculus class that this is a pretty common limit, but let me try to work through it step by step because sometimes I get confused between different limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, when x approaches 0, both sin(x) and x are approaching 0 as well. So we have a situation where the numerator and denominator both go to zero, which might mean that L’Hôpital’s Rule applies here. Wait, is that right? I think L’Hôpital’s Rule is used when you have an indeterminate form like 0/0 or ∞/∞. In this case, it's definitely 0/0 as x approaches 0 because sin(0) is 0 and so is just 0 in the denominator.\n",
      "\n",
      "So applying L’Hôpital’s Rule would involve taking derivatives of the numerator and the denominator separately and then taking the limit again. The derivative of sin(x) with respect to x is cos(x), and the derivative of x with respect to x is 1. So if I take those derivatives, I get:\n",
      "\n",
      "lim(x→0) [d/dx sin(x)] / [d/dx x] = lim(x→0) cos(x)/1\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplifying that, it's just lim(x→0) cos(x). Since cos(0) is 1, the limit should be 1. Okay, so that seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait a second, I also remember there's another way to find this limit without using L’Hôpital’s Rule because sometimes in exams or homework assignments they want you to use series expansions or geometric interpretations. Maybe I can try that method too and see if I get the same answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recall the Taylor series expansion of sin(x) around 0, which is also called the Maclaurin series. The expansion goes like this: sin(x) = x - (x^3)/6 + (x^5)/120 - ... So if I plug that into sin(x)/x, it becomes [x - (x^3)/6 + (x^5)/120 - ...]/x.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dividing each term by x gives me 1 - (x^2)/6 + (x^4)/120 - ... As x approaches 0, the higher power terms become negligible because they involve higher powers of x which get smaller. So essentially, as x gets closer to 0, sin(x)/x tends towards 1 minus some very small numbers approaching zero, so the limit is indeed 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe there's a geometric way to understand this without calculus? I think yes, using the unit circle and area comparisons or something like that. Let me visualize it in my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a point on the unit circle at angle x radians from (1,0). The coordinates of that point are (cos(x), sin(x)). If we draw a triangle from the center to that point, the base is cos(x), the height is sin(x), and the hypotenuse is 1 since it's the unit circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if I consider the area of different regions. There's an area of the sector which is (1/2)x, right? Because the area of a sector in a circle is (1/2)r^2θ, and here r=1. So that area is just x/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the area of the triangle formed by connecting the points (0,0), (cos(x), 0), and (cos(x), sin(x)). That area would be (base * height)/2 = (cos(x)*sin(x))/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a second, but I think actually that triangle is inside the sector. So perhaps there's another comparison? Maybe between the triangle, the sector, and some other region like a smaller triangle or something else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe it's about comparing sin(x) with x in terms of lengths on the unit circle. Let me see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that for angles near 0, the arc length (which is just x) is approximately equal to the sine of the angle because as the angle gets very small, the opposite side becomes almost equal to the arc length. So intuitively, sin(x) ≈ x when x is close to 0, which would make their ratio approach 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's more of an intuitive explanation rather than a proof, so maybe I need something more rigorous for this limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps using the squeeze theorem? That might be another way. The squeeze theorem says that if we have three functions f(x), g(x), and h(x) such that f(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ h(x) near x = a, and lim f(x) = lim h(x) = L as x approaches a, then lim g(x) is also L.\n",
      "\n",
      "So can I find two functions that bound sin(x)/x from above and below and both approach 1?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think yes. From what I recall in geometry, for angles between 0 and π/2 radians (0 to 90 degrees), the sine of x is less than or equal to x which is less than or equal to tangent of x.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, it's a bit different. Let me write that down properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 0 < x < π/2:\n",
      "\n",
      "sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, but how does that help with sin(x)/x? Well, if I divide all parts by sin(x), assuming sin(x) is positive which it is in this interval, we get:\n",
      "\n",
      "1 ≤ x/sin(x) ≤ 1/cos(x)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me check: Dividing sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x) by sin(x):\n",
      "\n",
      "Left inequality: sin(x)/sin(x) = 1 ≤ x/sin(x)\n",
      "\n",
      "Right inequality: x/sin(x) ≤ tan(x)/sin(x). But tan(x) is sin(x)/cos(x), so that's (sin(x)/cos(x))/sin(x) = 1/cos(x).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we have:\n",
      "\n",
      "1 ≤ x/sin(x) ≤ 1/cos(x)\n",
      "\n",
      "Which can be rewritten as:\n",
      "\n",
      "1 ≤ x/sin(x) ≤ 1/(cos(x))\n",
      "\n",
      "But since sin(x)/x is the reciprocal of x/sin(x), let's invert all parts. Since flipping inequalities reverses them, and because everything here is positive (for small positive x):\n",
      "\n",
      "1 ≥ sin(x)/x ≥ cos(x)\n",
      "\n",
      "Which simplifies to:\n",
      "\n",
      "cos(x) ≤ sin(x)/x ≤ 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as x approaches 0 from the right, cos(x) approaches cos(0) = 1. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, lim(x→0+) sin(x)/x is squeezed between two quantities both approaching 1, so it must also approach 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what about when x approaches 0 from the left? Well, since we're dealing with sin(-x)/(-x) which simplifies to (-sin(x))/(-x) = sin(x)/x. So actually, sin(x)/x is an even function in terms of sign; it's symmetric because sine is odd and x is odd as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me test that: If we substitute -x into the function:\n",
      "\n",
      "sin(-x)/(-x) = (-sin(x))/(-x) = (sin(x))/x\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, sin(x)/x is an even function. Therefore, lim(x→0-) sin(x)/x must also be equal to 1 because it's symmetric from both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the two-sided limit exists and equals 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, that seems a solid argument without using L’Hôpital’s Rule or series expansions, just geometry and inequalities. So in conclusion, lim(x→0) sin(x)/x = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse anything here. When x is negative approaching 0, how does it affect the inequality? Let's think about when x approaches from the left (negative side). Then, both numerator and denominator are negative: sin(-x) is -sin(x), so sin(x)/x becomes (-sin(x))/(-x) which simplifies to sin(x)/x. So even in that case, it reduces back to sin(x)/x.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I let x approach 0 from the left, say x = -h where h approaches 0 from the right, then sin(-h)/(-h) = (-sin(h))/(-h) = sin(h)/h which again is approaching 1 as h approaches 0. So yes, whether x comes from positive or negative side, sin(x)/x tends to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so both ways of thinking—applying L’Hôpital’s Rule, using the Taylor series expansion, and applying the squeeze theorem with geometric inequalities—lead me to the same answer: 1. So I can be pretty confident that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to recap:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using L’Hôpital’s Rule since it's a 0/0 indeterminate form:\n",
      "   - Take derivatives of numerator and denominator.\n",
      "   - Lim becomes cos(x), which is 1 as x approaches 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Using Taylor series expansion for sin(x):\n",
      "   - Expand sin(x) around 0, divide by x.\n",
      "   - The result tends to 1 as higher-order terms vanish.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Using geometric inequalities (Squeeze theorem):\n",
      "   - Compare areas on the unit circle and establish bounds.\n",
      "   - Show that sin(x)/x is squeezed between cos(x) and 1, both approaching 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "All methods lead to the same conclusion: The limit is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think I made any mistakes in these reasoning steps. Maybe initially when applying L’Hôpital’s Rule, one could worry about whether it's applicable here because sometimes people confuse different conditions for using it, but as long as both numerator and denominator approach 0 or infinity, which they do here (both sin(0) = 0 and 0), so L’Hôpital is definitely the right tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, in the squeeze theorem, I had to recall correctly that sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x) for 0 < x < π/2. Is this inequality correct? Let me sketch a unit circle: For an angle x, the sine (opposite side), tangent (opposite over adjacent). So yes, geometrically, in the first quadrant, between 0 and π/2, we have that sin(x) ≤ x ≤ tan(x).\n",
      "\n",
      "Dividing by sin(x):\n",
      "\n",
      "1 ≤ x/sin(x) ≤ 1/cos(x)\n",
      "\n",
      "Which translates to:\n",
      "\n",
      "cos(x) ≤ sin(x)/x ≤ 1\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, I was correct earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as a sanity check, what if I plug in some small values of x into my calculator?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take x = 0.1 radians (which is about 5.7 degrees):\n",
      "\n",
      "sin(0.1) ≈ 0.0998334\n",
      "\n",
      "So sin(0.1)/0.1 ≈ 0.998334, which is close to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "x = 0.01 radians:\n",
      "\n",
      "sin(0.01) ≈ 0.00999983\n",
      "\n",
      "Divide by x: ~0.999983, approaching 1 as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly for negative x:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = -0.1:\n",
      "\n",
      "sin(-0.1)/-0.1 = (-0.0998334)/(-0.1) ≈ 0.998334\n",
      "\n",
      "Same result.\n",
      "\n",
      "So numerically it also checks out, supporting the conclusion that the limit is indeed 1.\n",
